# r-kaggle-titanic
This repository contains some of my approaches to the famous Titanic survival prediction Problem from Kaggle.  The repository includes scripts for feature selection, alternate strategies for data modelling, the original test &amp; train data sets and the visualizations plots generated for the same. All code snippets are written in R.
